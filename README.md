# python_exercises

Python in terminal ctrl+c to S/D
Python, string = 1,2,3
Append 4
Sting = 1,2,3,4

Or x=5
y=5
Id x and id y have same id points to address not assigns value

==, != used for true false statements

But if you id it, it will give the same id for string before or after cuz python takes x and points it to an address, not assign a value,
